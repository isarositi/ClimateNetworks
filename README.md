# ClimateNetworks
Research Project at Aalto University. Title: "Comparison of Offline and Online Interaction of Climate Change Actors"

Nowadays, climate and sustainability are crucial aspects of any policymaking process in many countries, and this project aims to investigate the intricate dynamics among climate change players across five countries worldwide, exploring seven distinct networks with each nationâ€™s corporate landscape. These networks reveal diverse climate-related relationships among high-profile organizations and highlight nuanced decisionmaking processes regarding climate policies. Leveraging a dataset of tweets sourced from official accounts and employees of the companies in question, the behaviour of both the networks and the tweet content is been analysed. By performing topic modeling on the tweets, this research examines whether the presence of a direct connection significantly impacts the number of shared topics between two companies, which are ultimately found to be influenced by the connectivity of the networks andthe primary interests of their entities.
